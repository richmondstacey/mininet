### Goals

- Make mininet reactive/dynamic
- Scalability built-in
- Optimized for Python3
- Optimized via Cython
- Well tested and documented
- Python standards compliance
- Simplicity!!!
- Integrated REST API
- 3rd party dependencies are kept separate from the core framework.
- Plugin system for easily customizing node types, deployment, etc.
- Security!!!
- Built-in sflow (and other types of) monitoring?

### TODO

- Call mnexec.c directly via Cython extensions instead of subprocess?
